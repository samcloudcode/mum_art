# Stock Check Guide

How to verify physical inventory at a gallery location.

## When to Use

Run a stock check when you visit a gallery to confirm that:
- Items recorded in the system are physically present
- Nothing has been sold without being recorded
- Items haven't been moved or misplaced

## Starting a Stock Check

1. Go to **Galleries** and select the gallery you're visiting
2. Click **Start Stock Check** in the top-right corner
3. You'll see all in-stock editions grouped by artwork

## The Stock Check Screen

### Progress Bar
Shows how many items you've verified out of the total. Turns green when complete.

### Artwork Groups
Editions are grouped by artwork name (e.g., all "Bembridge" prints together). This matches how you'd naturally scan a gallery wall. Click a group header to collapse/expand it.

### Search
Use the search bar to quickly find specific editions:
- Type `Bembridge 47` to find edition 47 of Bembridge
- Or just type `Bembridge` to see all Bembridge editions

## Checking Items

### Verify an item
Tap the large checkbox next to an edition when you physically see it. The row turns green.

### Check all in a group
If you've verified all editions of an artwork, click **Check all X remaining** to mark them all at once.

### Flag a problem
If you can't find an item, or something seems wrong, tap the warning icon to flag it for review. Flagged items show an amber indicator.

## Finishing Up

When the progress bar shows 100% and turns green, you've completed the stock check.

### Flagged items
Any items you flagged will still be visible. Follow up on these - they might indicate:
- An unrecorded sale
- An item moved to a different location
- A data entry error

### Starting fresh
Click **Reset** to clear all checkmarks and start a new stock check. This is useful for periodic full inventory counts.

## Tips

- **Work systematically**: Walk the gallery wall-by-wall, checking items as you go
- **Use your phone**: The large checkboxes are designed for easy tapping on mobile
- **Flag liberally**: If in doubt, flag it - you can investigate later
- **Check the flagged count**: The progress bar shows how many items need follow-up
